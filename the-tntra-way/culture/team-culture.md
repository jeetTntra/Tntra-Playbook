# Introduction

This handbook is meant for new and existing team members at Tntra. It is a living document that will be updated as we learn and grow.

Culture: The way we do things around here at Tntra.

The culture of a team is the way that team members interact with each other. It is the way that they communicate, the 
way that they work together, and the way that they treat each other.

It is important to have a good team culture because it makes it easier to work together. It also makes it easier to
work with other teams.
