# Introduction

This handbook is meant for new and existing engineers at Tntra. It is a living document that will be updated as we learn and grow.

It is meant to be a guide for how we work, not a set of rules. We are a team of engineers, and we are always looking for ways to improve our processes. 

If you have suggestions, please open a pull request or issue in the handbook repository.

There are many things that can go wrong when building software. We have a set of [guiding principles]()
that help us make decisions when things get tough.

In most cases (if the team is competent) the reasons aren't technical. Projects fail because of the soft side of software development.
things like communication, planning, code review, style guides, continues integration, testing, team dynamics etc. This is why we have a [team culture]() that we strive to uphold.

This handbook brings all the engineers working at Tntra on the same page.
